## 🔒 Authentication Flow

The application uses Clerk for authentication with the following flow:

1. Users can browse public pages (Home, Features, Templates, Pricing) without authentication
2. Protected routes (Builder, Analyzer) require user sign-in
3. Sign-in/sign-up pages are provided with customized UI
4. After authentication, users are redirected to the homepage

## 🎨 Design System

ResumeAI features a modern, clean design with:

- Gradient accents using primary colors (blue, indigo)
- Responsive layouts adapting to different screen sizes
- Interactive animations and transitions
- Dark/light mode support through Tailwind theming
- Consistent spacing and typography

## 💾 Data Management

- Resume data is managed through React state
- Analyses are stored in browser storage for later access
- User authentication data is handled securely by Clerk

## 🧩 Core Components

### Resume Builder Components
- `ResumeForm`: Multi-section form for resume data input
- `ResumePreview`: Live preview of the resume being created
- `Builder`: Main page combining form and preview

### Resume Analyzer Components
- `FileUpload`: Upload interface for resume documents
- `AnalysisResult`: Display of the AI analysis results

### UI Components

## 🖨️ Export Flow

The PDF export process:
